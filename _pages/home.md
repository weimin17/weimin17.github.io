## About Me

Hi! I am Weimin Lyu, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stony Brook University</a>, advised by <a href="https://chaochen.github.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Chao Chen</a>.

<!-- , with expected graduation in Spring 2024.  -->
Currently I am looking for Intern - 2023 Summer. My availability date starts from May 1st, 2023 and can be extended to fall semester.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Application areas include Explainable AI (i.e., understanding attention mechanism in BERTs and ViTs under backdoor learning), Multi-modal Transformers (i.e., fusing clinical notes and clinical features for better mortality prediction), Healthcare AI (i.e., Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Opioid Overdose Risk Prediction).
